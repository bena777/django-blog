# django-blog
first use practice project with Django created with guidance from Corey Schafer

Heavily inspired and helped by Corey Schafers EXCELLENT Django YouTube tutorial. THe purpose of this app is to create a blog clone that uses aspects of the Django libray
such as an admin page, various apps, HTML/CSS, as well as built in Django functions. Creating this app allowed me to become more familer with Django as well as web dev in general
